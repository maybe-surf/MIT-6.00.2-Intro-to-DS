# MIT-6.00.2-Intro-to-DS
*Some code from MIT 6.00.2 [Intro to Data Science](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-computational-thinking-and-data-4) that I took on [edX](https://www.edx.org/) in spring 2021.* 

*Contains mostly the problem sets solutions.*

## Problem Set 1 (PS1)

*Optimization, knapsack problem, decision trees and dynamic programming.* 

**A little context for the problem set 1** (more can be found in the code comments)

>A colony of Aucks (super-intelligent alien bioengineers) has landed on Earth and has created new species of farm animals! The Aucks are performing their experiments on Earth, and plan on transporting the mutant animals back to their home planet of Aurock. In this problem set, you will implement algorithms to figure out how the aliens should shuttle their experimental animals back across space.

Basically this means how would you empty the set of objects of different weight if you can only take a limited weight at at time. 
Tries to find the most efficient (fastest) way to do it.

**ps1_partition** contains a generator helper function that generates all possible partitions of a set

**ps1 contains** the greedy approach, and the brute force algorithm

**ps1_cow_data** contains some basic data about the objects in a set

## PS2 (to be posted)
