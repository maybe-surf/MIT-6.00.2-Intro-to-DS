# MIT-6.00.2-Intro-to-DS
*Some code from MIT 6.00.2 [Intro to Data Science](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-computational-thinking-and-data-4) that I took on [edX](https://www.edx.org/) in spring 2021.* 

*Contains mostly the problem sets solutions.*

## Problem Set 1 (ps1)

*Optimization, knapsack problem, decision trees and dynamic programming.* 

**A little context for the problem set 1** (more can be found in the code comments)

ps1_partition contains a generator helper function that generates all possible partitions of a set

ps1 contains the greedy approach, and the brute force algorithm
